    <!--  Notes to translator:
        1. 'Ticket to Ride' is a product name and should not be translated.  'Score Keeper'
           should be translated.

        2. Only text in the contents of <string> and <item> should be translated.  Ignore text in
           comments, quotes, or the xml itself.

        3. Variable insertion:
           When variable text is inserted in a string, it is preceeded with a %.
           For example %1$s.
           The number after the % sign is the order of the variables.
           Typically these start at 1 and increase.  However, if you need to reorder
           the variables you can.
           The letter after the $ sign indicates the type of variable.  An 's'
           indicates a text string.  A 'd' indicates a number.

        4. Plurals:
           Plurals are indicated with a <plural> tag.  Each string needs to be translated
           individually.  The number of items can be zero, one, two, few, many, and other.
